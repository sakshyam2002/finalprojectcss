 <h1>DISCOVER BEST FOODS FROM NEPAL</h1>
	<br>
<h3 class="alignment">Nepal's most distinctive dishes are probably dal bhat (rice and lentils)  and the popular momos (dumplings).

  There is no better way to understand Nepal and the Nepali people, than through their cuisine. Nepal does not have one distinct 
  
  cooking style. However, food habits differ depending on the region. Nepali food has been influenced by Indian and Tibetan styles 
  
  of cooking. Authentic Nepali taste is found in Newari and Thakali cuisines. which are available in a large number of eateries 
  
  spread all over the valley. The regular Nepali Momo is veg Momo with achar (pickle/chutney) or just raw chillie. Curried meat is 
  
  very popular. Acquired from Tibetans, momos (steamed or fried dumplings) deserve a mention as one of the most popular snack among
   
  Nepalis. It is also taken as a whole meal especially by office goers during lunch. Rotis (flat bread) and dhedo (boiled flour) also
   
  make meals in some homes especially in rurl areas.

Wherever you go, your trip would be incomplete without getting an opportunity to taste the local cuisine i.e Momo. Depending upon 

culture and ethnicity, cooking in the Nepali homes (where the cooks are always the housewife) tend to settle curries with complex 

spices that she has learned from her mother, which traditionally has been in use for centuries. Nepal's cuisine is mostly, but not
 
all of them, spicy, however on request, spices can be reduced without compromising the taste of the dish.Newars, indigenous to the
  
Kathmandu Valley, cater the best snacks in the country. Their cuisine makes much use of buffalo meat, however, their vegetable 
  
soup is something else.Nepali people, normally have their lunch before leavingfor work, school, or colleges. For many theTibetan 

dish called momo is the staple diet during lunch. However this delicacy has been localized by adding a spicy soup in which the momos're 
 
floated and eaten together the way one eats noodle soup.This is known as momo cha and is religiously served at every
 
party and by most restaurants in town as if its the national dish.</h3>
